Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software applications. It is vital in the technological space because it enables the creation of sofware applications and systems that power various aspects of morden life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages, the establishement of software engineering as a discipline, the advent of structured programming and the rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design- Has to do with the designing of the system, application architecture and the user interface of the system
Development- Building and Coding in accordance to the design specifications
Testing- Identification of bugs and fixing them in order to ensure that the software meets the quality standard and functional requirements
Deployment- The release of the software to the users 
Maintenance- Ongoing support to users and improvement of the software via updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model is a linear and sequencial approach to project management while agile model is a iterative and incremental appproach.
Waterfall is less adaptive and lacks flexibility as compared to agile and it is used in cases were theres more predictability and the processes are recurring.
Agile model however has feedback loops and changes can instantly be made if a feature is not desired, ego proving its flexibility and it is much more adaptable.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Has the responsibility of writing code and implementing software solutions 
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures the quality of the software by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's-Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and test code (Visual studio, Eclipse)
VSC- Software tools for tracking source code changes and coordinating work among team members (Git, Suubversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Chaning Requuirements- the requirements may change during the developmentment cycle and this may lead to scope creep and project delays
Tight Rush- Pressure to deliver software products on time may result in rushed development and comprised quality 
Technical Debt- Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Tests out the individual units or modules in a system
Intergration testing- tests out the interaction between this units in a system
System testing- the entire system is tested
Acceptance testing- the system is tested against the user requirements to ensure relevance

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting and structuring of questions and/or statements in order for best possible responses to be attained from AI models. It is imperative as it enables the user to obtain specific and relevant information.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague promt-What is the largets country in africa?
Concise promt- what is the largest country in Africa by percentage Landmass?
The Second promt is much more clearer to what the user wants as it is specific to percentage landmass and without the specification the answer could have included the largest country by GDP, population, etc.
